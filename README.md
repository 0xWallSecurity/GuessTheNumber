## About
Guess The Number is a simple raffle game, where the user pays a small fee to enter a game and picks a number. If that number is equivalent to the contracts number picked, the user wins the contracts prize pool. The contract takes a 5% cut as a fee of each game, which will not be payed out.

## Set Up
### Prerequesites
This project needs foundry to be installed to run the tests. Check via `forge -V`.
For the `make` commands, make needs to be installed. Check via `make -v`.
Furthermore `make` requires the local anvil node to be running. Open a terminal and run `anvil`.

### make
Run `make runScript` to deploy the contract to your local anvil node. You can then interact with the contract via forge cast or writing your own scripts.
Run `make runTest` or `make runTestVerbose` to run tests. 

## TODO
1. expand testing:
