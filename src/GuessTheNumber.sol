What is this all about?
--> 1. Player pays small fee to enter the game. -- DONE
  --> 1.1. 5% of fee is taken as cut by contract, 95% goes into prize pool -- DONE
--> 2. Player picks a number, contract does too -- DONE
  --> 2.1. Number must be in [0,99] -- DONE
--> 3.1. If player picked the right number: player wins prize pool -- DONE
--> 3.2. If player picked wrong number: game ends, prize pool goes up -- DONE

--> a) contract belongs to owner, who can withdraw the contracts cut at all times -- DONE
--> b) players cannot withdraw from the contract. The prize pool is payed out automatically -- DONE

TODO:
1. Implement real randomness with chainlink VRF (CORRECT_GUESS was for testing only)
2. Expand the functionality. Some ideas:
    a) allow more players to play over a specific timeframe. Every player can roll once.
        Prize pool divided among all players who guessed correctly depending on entrance fee payed (higher payment -> higher payout)
    b)
